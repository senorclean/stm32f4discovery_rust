# stm32f4discovery_rust

Simple project to test out the RTIC framework as well as Rust on a familiar embedded platform (STM32F4 Discovery Board). The STM32F4xx-HAL is still pretty green at this point, so I don't plan on doing much more with this project. Feel free to use any of the code as a starting point for your own projects.
